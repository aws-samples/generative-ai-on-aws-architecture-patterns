## Clean up
If you use own AWS account, you must delete provisioning resources to avoid unnecessary charges. You don't need to clean up if you use a workshop instructor provided account.

Remove the application CloudFormation stack:
- Execute in the Cloud9 terminal: `sam delete`. Wait until stacks are deleted

Delete the AWS Cloud9 environment is you don't need it anymore.
